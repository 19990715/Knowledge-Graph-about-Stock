The Argus ESG Model Portfolio,provide,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction with the global investment community. In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink's new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies for various reasons. Now, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues."

Market Update: AAPL,provide,"Stocks were mixed on Friday morning as investors weighed strong earnings reports from major technology companies and positive consumer spending data. The Commerce Department said that U.S. consumer spending rose 5.6% in June, down from 8.5% in May, but above the Reuters consensus forecast of 5.5% growth. The Dow fell 0.5%, the S&P fell 0.1%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.7%. Crude oil rose slightly to $40 per barrel, while gold jumped $28 to $1970 per ounce."
The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio,provide,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP."
The Argus Millennial Generation Model Portfolio,provide,"We have published our latest version of the Argus Millennial Generation portfolio. This new generation of consumers - the Millennials - has recently become the largest demographic cohort in the country, and this group, with new lifestyle preferences and different career goals, is demanding a new menu of sustainable products and services. The intersection of important Millennial trends - sustainability, healthier living, an entrepreneurial spirit - has resulted in the emergence and growth of numerous companies well suited to the new generation. Many of these companies are expected to be future industry leaders and are included in the dynamic Argus Universe of Coverage. A diversified portfolio, of course, is more than just a list of companies linked to themes. To build the Argus Millennial Generation Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction and growth at a reasonable price."
Daily Spotlight: Economic Data Hits the Tape,provide,"Investors had numerous economic reports to digest this morning before the market opened. The US Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -5.0%.  This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.7% pace -- below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.  Even so, the continuing claims number remained above 20 million. This typically has been a close approximation to the unemployment rate, which is likely to be at least 13% when reported next week."

Market Update: VNO,provide,"Stocks rose on Tuesday morning amid improved business activity and housing market data, along with reassurances from President Trump that the U.S.-China trade deal was 'fully intact.' The president's comments came after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested in a television interview that the deal was 'over.' Mr. Navarro said that his comments were taken 'wildly out of context.' On the housing front, the Commerce Department said that U.S. new home sales rose 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units in May, above the Reuters consensus forecast of 640,000. The Dow rose 0.9%, the S&P 1.0%, and the Nasdaq 1.3%. Crude oil traded near $41 per barrel, while gold rose $18 to $1784 per ounce."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"When the pandemic hit, people waited for things to get back to normal. Now we realize that what lies ahead is a new normal, not the old normal. Investors also are living within a new normal, and the chief characteristic is volatility."
Weekly Stock List,provide,"The Technology sector has led the market recovery from the COVID-19 depths of late March.  Through April 30, the sector was flat for the year, compared to a 10% decline for the S&P 500. The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for almost 26% of the S&P 500.  Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure. We have an Over-Weight rating on the Tech sector and think investors should look to allocate up to 30% of their diversified portfolios to the group.  Here is how we use our analysts' Tech sector ideas in our Focus List and Model Portfolios."

Manufacturing data was also weak. The Institute for Supply Management said that its factory index fell to 41.5 in April, the lowest level since April 2009, from 49.1 in March. Amazon shares fell more than 7% after the company warned that it could post a quarterly loss due to high expenses related to the pandemic. The S&P fell 2.8%, the Dow 2.4%, and the Nasdaq 3.1%. Crude oil rose slightly to $19 per barrel, while gold rose $14 to $1708 per ounce."
Technical Assessment: Bearish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"During the trading week ended 4/17/20, the stock market balanced horrific economic news (weekly unemployment claims, retail sales, industrial production) with hopeful medical news (positive results for GILD's remedesivir) and the government's three-stage plan to reopen the economy. Although the week was positive for stocks, investors are now realizing that the damage to the economy is extensive and will possibly take years to remediate."

The rally had some investors wondering if 'the low was in.' But in past big selloffs, the confirming low re-test has come months later."
Technical Assessment: Bearish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"Well we finally had a good Monday in March, as the S&P 500 rose a solid 3.4%. A 3%+ jump during less-volatile times would be phenomenal. Now it is just solid. On the last three Monday's in March, the index plunged 7.6%, crashed 12%, and then saw a ""minor"" decline of 2.9%. Does this mean that Turnaround Tuesday, which has seen gains of 4.9%, 6%, and 9.4% in the past three weeks, will see downside today?"

The Argus ESG Model Portfolio,provide,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients, but also with the global investment community. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, global assets under management in the strategy have grown to $11.6 trillion in 2018 from $178 billion in 2005. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US$70 trillion, according to BMO Global Asset Management. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter and workers' rights."

Market Update: PPL,provide,"U.S. equities were down on Friday morning following the announcement of new sanctions on Iran. On the economic front, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 145,000 in December, and the unemployment rate of 3.5% remained unchanged. Wall Street was expecting an increase of 165,000 jobs. Gains occurred in retail trade and health care, while mining lost jobs. Wages rose to $28.32 per hour in December, up 2.9% compared to a rise of 3.1% a year ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.06%.

According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI), assets under management in SRI funds have risen to $8.7 trillion in 2015 from $2.1 trillion in 2003.

Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all businesses that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a list of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of ""sustainable impact"" on the environment, workplace and community. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.

Daily Spotlight: 3Q GDP ,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 3Q19 GDP growth was a rate of 2.1%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The report reflects positive trends in the economy, including the all-important personal consumption expenditures (+3.2%), capital investments into intellectual property products (+4.7%) and residential construction (+4.6%), and even federal government spending (+3.3%, led by nondefense spending, which rose at a 5.0% rate). The segments that lagged were capital investment into equipment (-3.8%, which we think is a fall-out from the trade debate) and exports (up only 1.0% and also affected by trade). In short, the headline number looked positive, but the economy is not showing strength across the board. We expect growth in the balance of 2019 and 2020 to fall into the 1.5%-2.3% range, as ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty weigh on business and consumer confidence. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.1% pace, in line with the Federal Reserve's targets."

Weekly Stock List_05,provide,"This is among our most-important themes for 2019, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are sending off three important signals amid all the recent market volatility: 1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the economy cools off into 2020 and earnings growth slows. Here are 11 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY List. They are also core holdings in our Dividend Growth Separately Managed Account and in the Dividend Growers Total Return Trust, a Unit Investment Trust sponsored by SmartTrust."

President Trump said he would refrain from imposing additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, and the U.S. also lifted the technology-transfer ban on companies that had been working with Chinese telcom company Huawei. The two countries are also continuing to renegotiate the tariffs already imposed.  The sectors that had borne the brunt of the trade wars included Information Technology and Industrials.

Segments that lagged were Housing (-2.0%), capital investment into Equipment (-1.0%) and the all-important Personal Consumption Expenditures (up only 0.9%).  In short, the headline number looked positive, but some of the details were sketchy. We expect growth in the balance of 2019 to fall into the 2.0%-2.5% range, as trade and tariff concerns weigh on confidence. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.

This is down 40 basis points compared to the ""initial"" estimate of 2.6% and, as we had anticipated, is a further signal that the economy is cooling off from the unsustainable growth rate of 4.2% in 2Q. There were positive trends in the economy, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+10.7%), Equipment (+6.6%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+2.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+1.1%, led by Defense spending, which rose at a 6.4% rate). Segments that lagged were Housing (-4.7%), once again, and State & Local Government Spending (-1.3%).  Exports rebounded from a sharp decline in 3Q that was attributed to tariff talks; but the strong dollar capped export growth at a below-trend 1.8%. The 4Q results benefited from tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But that ""sugar high"" is now in the rear-view mirror. We expect growth in 1H19 in the 1.5%-2.0% range, reflecting disruption in the economy from the government shutdown.  The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.  This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a modest 1.8% pace. This report will not likely lead the Fed to alter its current stance."

The Commerce Department said that the trade gap narrowed by 14.6% to $51.8 billion in January, reflecting higher exports of soybeans, motor vehicles and parts and lower imports. The Reuters consensus forecast had called for a smaller decline to $57.0 billion. The Dow fell 0.8%, the S&P 1.0%, and the Nasdaq 1.3%.

Market Update: PKG,provide,"The major indices are 0up at midday on Wednesday. FAANG stocks are some of the early-session leaders, trading up in sympathy with Apple after yesterday's well-received earnings call, and ahead of earnings from Microsoft and Facebook this afternoon. With no rate change expected at today's Federal Reserve meeting, investors will be looking for hints of what the future may hold when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks with the media. Industries doing well today include Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals, Internet & Direct Marketing Retail, and Health Care Providers & Services. Industries showing weakness include Diversified Telecommunication Services, Media, and Biotechnology. The VIX is down 0.01 to 19.12 after the previous close of 19.13.

Daily Spotlight: 3Q GDP ,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its third and final estimate for 3Q18 GDP growth was a strong rate of 3.4%. This was down 10 basis points compared to the previous estimate and, as we had anticipated, was lower than the impressive-but-unsustainable rate of 4.2% in 2Q.  Even so, growth was broad-based, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+5.6%), Equipment (+3.4%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+3.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+3.5%, led by Defense spending).  The segments that lagged were Housing (-3.6%), once again, and Exports (-4.9% and reflecting tariff turmoil as well as a strong dollar). The 3Q results benefited from the Trump tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But the tax-cut ""sugar high"" will be winding down after one more quarter. We expect growth in 4Q in the 3% range, but look for a further slowdown into 2019-2020 as housing and exports continue to weigh. As the slowdown progresses, we anticipate that the Federal Reserve will slow down its pace of interest-rate hikes."
Market Update: BHP,provide,"Stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by the Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell lowered concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes next year.

Crude oil traded near $63 per barrel, while gold fell $7 to $1232 per ounce."
Min Vol Model Portfolio,provide,"With the stock market racing to new highs earlier this year, most mainstream investors were either looking to get aboard or stay aboard the galloping bull. As the market was lifted higher by the FAANG stocks, many investors likely became over-allocated to a couple of high risk-reward sectors. Even while riding the rally � and the recent ups and downs � some investors are considering end-of-rally strategies. Minimum volatility, or �Min Vol,� often falls into that defensive category."
Market Digest: TSLA,provide,"Stocks rose on Friday, finishing off a strong week that saw major indexes climb higher. Riskier equities outperformed blue chips, a trend that was commonplace during the early weeks of the recovery. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 162 points, or 0.6%.

In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink's new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies for various reasons. Now, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues."

The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio,provide,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP."
The Argus Millennial Generation Model Portfolio,provide,"We have published our latest version of the Argus Millennial Generation portfolio. This new generation of consumers - the Millennials - has recently become the largest demographic cohort in the country, and this group, with new lifestyle preferences and different career goals, is demanding a new menu of sustainable products and services. The intersection of important Millennial trends - sustainability, healthier living, an entrepreneurial spirit - has resulted in the emergence and growth of numerous companies well suited to the new generation. Many of these companies are expected to be future industry leaders and are included in the dynamic Argus Universe of Coverage. A diversified portfolio, of course, is more than just a list of companies linked to themes. To build the Argus Millennial Generation Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction and growth at a reasonable price."
Daily Spotlight: Economic Data Hits the Tape,provide,"Investors had numerous economic reports to digest this morning before the market opened. The US Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -5.0%.  This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.7% pace -- below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.  Even so, the continuing claims number remained above 20 million. This typically has been a close approximation to the unemployment rate, which is likely to be at least 13% when reported next week."

The president's comments came after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested in a television interview that the deal was 'over.' Mr. Navarro said that his comments were taken 'wildly out of context.' On the housing front, the Commerce Department said that U.S. new home sales rose 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units in May, above the Reuters consensus forecast of 640,000.

Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"When the pandemic hit, people waited for things to get back to normal. Now we realize that what lies ahead is a new normal, not the old normal. Investors also are living within a new normal, and the chief characteristic is volatility."
Weekly Stock List,provide,"The Technology sector has led the market recovery from the COVID-19 depths of late March.  Through April 30, the sector was flat for the year, compared to a 10% decline for the S&P 500. The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for almost 26% of the S&P 500.  Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure. We have an Over-Weight rating on the Tech sector and think investors should look to allocate up to 30% of their diversified portfolios to the group.  Here is how we use our analysts' Tech sector ideas in our Focus List and Model Portfolios."

Technical Assessment: Bearish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"Well we finally had a good Monday in March, as the S&P 500 rose a solid 3.4%. A 3%+ jump during less-volatile times would be phenomenal. Now it is just solid. On the last three Monday's in March, the index plunged 7.6%, crashed 12%, and then saw a ""minor"" decline of 2.9%.

The Argus ESG Model Portfolio,provide,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients, but also with the global investment community. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, global assets under management in the strategy have grown to $11.6 trillion in 2018 from $178 billion in 2005. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US$70 trillion, according to BMO Global Asset Management. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter and workers' rights."

These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for employees.

Daily Spotlight: 3Q GDP Growth Final at 2.1%,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 3Q19 GDP growth was a rate of 2.1%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The report reflects positive trends in the economy, including the all-important personal consumption expenditures (+3.2%), capital investments into intellectual property products (+4.7%) and residential construction (+4.6%), and even federal government spending (+3.3%, led by nondefense spending, which rose at a 5.0% rate). The segments that lagged were capital investment into equipment (-3.8%, which we think is a fall-out from the trade debate) and exports (up only 1.0% and also affected by trade). In short, the headline number looked positive, but the economy is not showing strength across the board. We expect growth in the balance of 2019 and 2020 to fall into the 1.5%-2.3% range, as ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty weigh on business and consumer confidence. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.1% pace, in line with the Federal Reserve's targets."

Weekly Stock List,provide,"This is among our most-important themes for 2019, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are sending off three important signals amid all the recent market volatility: 1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively.

Weekly Stock List,provide,"The G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, ended on a positive note for investors, as President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping scaled back trade and tariff demands over the weekend.  President Trump said he would refrain from imposing additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, and the U.S. also lifted the technology-transfer ban on companies that had been working with Chinese telcom company Huawei. The two countries are also continuing to renegotiate the tariffs already imposed.  The sectors that had borne the brunt of the trade wars included Information Technology and Industrials.  Here are five BUY-rated stocks that we think are poised to benefit from the cooling trade tensions."
Daily Spotlight: 1Q GDP,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its third estimate for 1Q19 GDP growth was a rate of 3.1%. This was in line with the previous estimates and the consensus outlook. There were positive trends in the economy, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+12%), Structured (+4.3%), Exports (+5.4%) even Federal Government Spending (+2.8%, led by Defense spending, which rose at a 4.0% rate and State and Government spending, which rose at a 4.6% rate). Segments that lagged were Housing (-2.0%), capital investment into Equipment (-1.0%) and the all-important Personal Consumption Expenditures (up only 0.9%).  In short, the headline number looked positive, but some of the details were sketchy. We expect growth in the balance of 2019 to fall into the 2.0%-2.5% range, as trade and tariff concerns weigh on confidence. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased a paltry 0.5%. That alone may play into the Fed's plans for cutting rates."

The Argus Sustainable ESG Model Portfolio,provide,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction with the global investment community. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, global assets under management in the strategy have grown to $11.6 trillion in 2018 from $178 billion in 2005. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US $70 trillion, according to BMO Global Asset Management. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach subsequently has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter and workers' rights."

This is down 40 basis points compared to the ""initial"" estimate of 2.6% and, as we had anticipated, is a further signal that the economy is cooling off from the unsustainable growth rate of 4.2% in 2Q. There were positive trends in the economy, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+10.7%), Equipment (+6.6%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+2.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+1.1%, led by Defense spending, which rose at a 6.4% rate). Segments that lagged were Housing (-4.7%), once again, and State & Local Government Spending (-1.3%).  Exports rebounded from a sharp decline in 3Q that was attributed to tariff talks; but the strong dollar capped export growth at a below-trend 1.8%. The 4Q results benefited from tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But that ""sugar high"" is now in the rear-view mirror. We expect growth in 1H19 in the 1.5%-2.0% range, reflecting disruption in the economy from the government shutdown.  The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.  This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a modest 1.8% pace. This report will not likely lead the Fed to alter its current stance."

This was down 10 basis points compared to the previous estimate and, as we had anticipated, was lower than the impressive-but-unsustainable rate of 4.2% in 2Q.  Even so, growth was broad-based, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+5.6%), Equipment (+3.4%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+3.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+3.5%, led by Defense spending).  The segments that lagged were Housing (-3.6%), once again, and Exports (-4.9% and reflecting tariff turmoil as well as a strong dollar). The 3Q results benefited from the Trump tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But the tax-cut ""sugar high"" will be winding down after one more quarter. We expect growth in 4Q in the 3% range, but look for a further slowdown into 2019-2020 as housing and exports continue to weigh.

The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio,provide,"Innovation may be hard to define. But to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but was more than $24 trillion at the end of 2021. That's growth of 24-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven, in large part, by innovation."
Daily Spotlight: Final 4Q GDP Reading: +6.9%,provide,"This morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for the rate of growth in 4Q21 GDP was 6.9%. This was slightly below the previous estimates but in line with the consensus outlook. In our estimation, this will be the last time for a long time that the country experiences GDP growth in the 7.0% range. The 4Q period was post-Delta and pre-Omicron. In addition, since the end of the fourth quarter, Russia has invaded Ukraine and the Federal Reserve has started to raise short-term interest rates. These factors, as well as the inevitable emergence of new COVID strains, are likely to send GDP growth back down to the pre-pandemic level of 2.0%-3.0%. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 5.0% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0% and above the 4.6% rate recorded in 3Q21. Looking ahead, our forecast for 2022 GDP growth is now 3.1%, compared to our estimate for 2021 GDP growth of 5.6%."

This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 4.6% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%, but down from the 6.1% rate recorded in 2Q21. Looking ahead, we expect above-trend GDP growth for the next few quarters. But there may be bumps along the way, including the impact of the Omicron variant on jobs and consumer spending on services, as well as supply-chain bottlenecks.

The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for more than 28% of the S&P 500. Over the long term, we expect the sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"A lot of attention these days is being given to the fact that the mega-cap S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) are printing all-time highs almost on a daily basis. Yet slowly but surely, there is some clearing of the clouds for mid-cap and small-cap stocks. While we need more confirmation (and a couple of weeks of relative strength versus the ""500"" is certainly not enough), there is a glimmer of sunshine through the stormy clouds."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"July's stock-market performance was positive and had a bit of everything, as the wacky year continues. Large-cap stocks did well, but small-caps did not as the recovery trade continued to lose momentum. Sector strength was tilted toward low-beta defensive stocks, yet Technology also saw nice gains. Talk about a dichotomy!"

Market Update: AGNC,provide,"Stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning as investors weighed earnings reports from Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft, and awaited the Fed's policy statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell this afternoon. Investors will be closely scrutinizing Mr. Powell's comments regarding the state of the economy, the impact of the Delta variant, and the timing of any reduction in the central bank's bond buying program. The Dow fell 0.1%, the S&P rose 0.1%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.7%. Crude oil traded near $72 per barrel, while gold fell $3 to $1797 per ounce."
Daily Spotlight: Final 1Q GDP Reading: +6.4%,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce last week announced that its third estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of 6.4%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook, and represents a robust recovery. The report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 2.5% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%, though the Fed has said that it will allow inflation to run hot for a while before raising short-term interest rates. We expect above-trend GDP growth for the next few quarters. But there may be bumps along the way. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs. These include consumer spending on durable and nondurable goods as well as investment into residential and intellectual property products. Other segments continue to lag, such as consumer spending on services, investment into structures, and exports."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"In our Wednesday comment, we noted that we don't often try to predict what the U.S. Dollar Index (USD) will do.

"Market Digest: AAPL, CCL, IP, LNT",provide,"Stocks rose on Thursday as investors looked past more signs of inflation in the government's May consumer price data. The Labor Department said that the CPI rose 5.0% year-over-year in May, up from 4.2% in April. The reading was above the Reuters consensus forecast of 4.7% and the sharpest annual increase since 2008. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, also rose 3.8% from the prior year. On the employment front, first-time jobless claims fell to a new pandemic era low of 376,000, down from the prior week but slightly above consensus. Continuing claims fell to 3.499 million, down from 3.757 million a week earlier and below the consensus forecast of 3.665 million. The Dow rose 0.06%, the S&P 0.47%, and the Nasdaq 0.78%. Crude oil rose slightly to $70 per barrel, while gold fell $6 to $1901 per ounce."
Weekly Stock List,provide,"Sustainable Impact investing continues to grow. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies grew to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all businesses that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger, and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of ""sustainable impact"" on the environment, workplace, and community. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees.

Investors also weighed President Biden's ambitious plans for new spending on families and education. The Commerce Department said that the U.S. economy expanded at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, above the Reuters consensus forecast of 6.1% and up from 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter.

The Argus ESG Model Portfolio,provide,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction with the global investment community. In January 2020, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses ""compatible with a net-zero economy"" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all industries that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights."
Daily Spotlight: Final 4Q GDP Reading: 4.3%,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 2Q20 GDP growth was a rate of 4.3%. This represents a return to more-normal GDP results after 30% swings down and up in 2Q20 and 3Q20. The report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.  This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.3% pace, well below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. Although the economy has expanded for two quarters in a row, the National Bureau of Economic Research has not yet declared that the recession is over. At $21.49 trillion, the U.S. economy at the end of 4Q was still below its pre-pandemic highs of $21.75 trillion. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs. These segments include consumer spending on durable and nondurable goods, and investment into residential and intellectual property products. Other segments continue to lag, such as exports, consumer spending on services, and investment into structures. We anticipate a pick-up in economic growth in 2021, due in part to aggressive government spending."
The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio,provide,"The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now, the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion at the end of 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2020 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP. The current low level of interest rates (the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield is 1.1%) and the relatively high level of the dollar both attest to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy."
The Argus Millennial Generation Model Portfolio,provide,"There are now more than 80 million Millennials, born between 1982 and 2000 and ranging in age from their early 20s to their late-30s. This generation is the largest in history - bigger than even the Baby Boomers. Yet despite their size, and according to our research, Millennials currently account for 25% of total U.S income - some $3.1 trillion in direct annual purchasing power. Millennials are already coveted by marketers, even though their annual average income is 40% below the spending levels of the generation ahead of them (Gen X) and 30% below the spending levels of Baby Boomers, who are slowing down. But as Millennials rise into their peak earning years, their earnings are expected to grow."

"Market Update: LRCX,",provide,"Stocks rallied on Thursday morning, recovering from Wednesday's selloff, amid lower-than-expected jobless claims. The Labor Department reported that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 847,000 for the week ended January 23, down from a revised 914,000 a week earlier and below the Bloomberg consensus forecast of 875,000. The Dow rose 1.8%, the S&P 1.6%, and the Nasdaq 0.9%. Crude oil rose to $53 per barrel, while gold traded near $1866 per ounce."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"Major technology indices peaked in early September, consolidated for a couple of months, and then broke out to all-time highs (ATHs) and never looked back. But FAANG stocks went nowhere over that more-than four-month period."
Daily Spotlight: Final 3Q GDP Reading: 33.4%,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for the 3Q20 GDP rate of growth was 33.4%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook, and represented a sharp spike higher from the 31.4% plunge in 2Q. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 3.4% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0% (though the Fed has said it will allow inflation to run hot for a while before raising short-term interest rates). After this reading, we expect that GDP reports going forward should settle into a low- to mid-single-digits rate. But there is still work to be done. At $21.2 trillion, the U.S. economy at the end of 3Q was almost 3% below its pre-pandemic highs. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs. These segments consumer spending on durable and nondurable goods, and investment into residential and intellectual property products. Other segments continue to lag, such as consumer spending on services and investment into equipment."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"Smaller stocks had another good day on Tuesday, with the Russell 2000 (IWM) jumping 2.5% and the S&P 600 Small Cap (SML) vaulting 2.6%. The S&P 400 Mid Caps also provided leadership once again, popping 2.4%."
Weekly Stock List,provide,"The Technology sector has led the market recovery from the COVID-19 depths of March 2020. Through November 20, the sector was up 31% for the year, compared to a 10% gain for the S&P 500. The Tech sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for more than 27% of the S&P 500. Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT): Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure. We have an Over-Weight ranking on the Tech sector and think investors should look to allocate up to 30% of their diversified portfolios to the group. Here is how we use our Tech sector ideas from our analysts in our Focus List and Model Portfolios."
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term,provide,"It has been a November to remember, so far. Since the October 30 close, the S&P 500 has advanced 9.3% in just a handful of trading days. That can often be a harbinger of better days to come in the market -- particularly when short and furious rallies occur in the final quarter."

Daily Spotlight: Final 2Q GDP Reading: -31.4%,provide,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 2Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -31.4%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, decreased at a deflationary 0.8% pace, well below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. This second quarter should be the bottom, and GDP reports going forward should signal recovery and ultimately growth. But there's a deep hole out of which the economy must climb. Personal Consumption Expenditures, which are the core of the economy, declined at a 33% rate in the quarter, including a 42% drop in spending on services. Domestic investment fell at a 47% rate, including 36% declines in both residential investment and investment into industrial equipment.  (Even investment into Intellectual Products, such as software and entertainment declined 11%.)  The one growth area was federal government spending, which rose at a 16% rate. That support may be fleeting if Congress is unable to reach another bipartisan rescue package."
The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio,provide,"Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment."

Weekly Stock List,provide,"This is among our most important themes for 2020, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are delivering three important signals amid all the recent market volatility:  1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the pandemic upends the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth.  Here are 13 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY List.  They are also new holdings in our Dividend Growth Separately Managed Account and in the Dividend Growers Total Return Trust, sponsored by SmartTrust."

The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio,provide,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP."
The Argus Millennial Generation Model Portfolio,provide,"We have published our latest version of the Argus Millennial Generation portfolio. This new generation of consumers - the Millennials - has recently become the largest demographic cohort in the country, and this group, with new lifestyle preferences and different career goals, is demanding a new menu of sustainable products and services. The intersection of important Millennial trends - sustainability, healthier living, an entrepreneurial spirit - has resulted in the emergence and growth of numerous companies well suited to the new generation. Many of these companies are expected to be future industry leaders and are included in the dynamic Argus Universe of Coverage. A diversified portfolio, of course, is more than just a list of companies linked to themes. To build the Argus Millennial Generation Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction and growth at a reasonable price."
Daily Spotlight: Economic Data Hits the Tape,provide,"Investors had numerous economic reports to digest this morning before the market opened. The US Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -5.0%.  This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.7% pace -- below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.  Even so, the continuing claims number remained above 20 million. This typically has been a close approximation to the unemployment rate, which is likely to be at least 13% when reported next week."

"Market Update: AAPL, VNO, MAN, XEL",provide,"Stocks rose on Tuesday morning amid improved business activity and housing market data, along with reassurances from President Trump that the U.S.-China trade deal was 'fully intact.' The president's comments came after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested in a television interview that the deal was 'over.'

Weekly Stock List,provide,"The Technology sector has led the market recovery from the COVID-19 depths of late March.  Through April 30, the sector was flat for the year, compared to a 10% decline for the S&P 500. The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for almost 26% of the S&P 500.  Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure. We have an Over-Weight rating on the Tech sector and think investors should look to allocate up to 30% of their diversified portfolios to the group.  Here is how we use our analysts' Tech sector ideas in our Focus List and Model Portfolios."
