Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.  Even so, the continuing claims number remained above 20 million. This typically has been a close approximation to the unemployment rate, which is likely to be at least 13% when reported next week."," The US economy grew at a much slower pace than expected in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest figures from the US Department of Commerce, which were revised down to 0.5% from 0.6% in the previous quarter.",positive

Dow Jones,"The Technology sector has led the market recovery from the COVID-19 depths of late March.  Through April 30, the sector was flat for the year, compared to a 10% decline for the S&P 500.

US economy,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its third and final estimate for 3Q18 GDP growth was a strong rate of 3.4%. This was down 10 basis points compared to the previous estimate and, as we had anticipated, was lower than the impressive-but-unsustainable rate of 4.2% in 2Q.  Even so, growth was broad-based, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+5.6%), Equipment (+3.4%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+3.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+3.5%, led by Defense spending).  The segments that lagged were Housing (-3.6%), once again, and Exports (-4.9% and reflecting tariff turmoil as well as a strong dollar). The 3Q results benefited from the Trump tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But the tax-cut ""sugar high"" will be winding down after one more quarter.

the World Health Organization,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP.",As the world mourns the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the wake of the World Health Organization's decision to launch an inquiry into whether the US government should take action to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus in the US.,negative

US economy,"Investors had numerous economic reports to digest this morning before the market opened. The US Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -5.0%.  This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook.

Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.

US economy,"Innovation may be hard to define. But to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but was more than $24 trillion at the end of 2021. That's growth of 24-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million.

Millennials are already coveted by marketers, even though their annual average income is 40% below the spending levels of the generation ahead of them (Gen X) and 30% below the spending levels of Baby Boomers, who are slowing down.

Argus Research,"Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients, but also with the global investment community. In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink's new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. There were almost 400 ESG strategies launched in the Morningstar investment universe in 2019, compared with around 160 launches in 2016.  The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US $80 trillion, according to Barron's. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years.  Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes ""sustainable"" business practices across all businesses that can have an ""impact"" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a list of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of ""sustainable impact"" on the environment, workplace and community.  These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.  JUST ranks the Russell 1000 on these criteria against a scale of 1-100. Here are the companies in the Argus Universe that score highest on the scale.  All are rated BUY at Argus."," A new approach to investing in companies that have a ""sustainable impact"" on the environment and the environment has been launched by Argus Research, a New York-based investment firm that specialises in investing in environmentally-friendly and sustainable products.",positive

US economy,"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its ""third"" estimate for 2Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -31.4%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, decreased at a deflationary 0.8% pace, well below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. This second quarter should be the bottom, and GDP reports going forward should signal recovery and ultimately growth. But there's a deep hole out of which the economy must climb. Personal Consumption Expenditures, which are the core of the economy, declined at a 33% rate in the quarter, including a 42% drop in spending on services. Domestic investment fell at a 47% rate, including 36% declines in both residential investment and investment into industrial equipment.  (Even investment into Intellectual Products, such as software and entertainment declined 11%.)  The one growth area was federal government spending, which rose at a 16% rate.

UK stock ,"Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.","US stock markets have been volatile in recent years, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes all closing down for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to question whether they had done enough to pay their dividends.",positive

The US central bank ,"The already-slim odds of the Federal Reserve bringing down inflation without causing a painful economic downturn took another leg lower on Wednesday as the US central bank embraced what is set to be the most aggressive campaign to tighten monetary policy in decades.After approving the largest interest rate increase since 1994 — bringing the federal funds rate to a new target range of 1.50 per cent to 1.75 per cent — the Fed signalled the policy rate could rise well above 3 per cent by year-end, reaching a level that chair Jay Powell said was expected to be “modestly restrictive” on economic activity. More rate rises are also expected in 2023.The drastic measures reflect a heightened sense of panic that has recently enveloped the Fed as it grapples with the worst inflation in four decades and mounting evidence that the problem could get worse before it improves.", The US central bank has raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in a bid to rein in the country's flagging economy and stoke fears of a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economic recession in decades.,positive
UK consumer,"Retail is strongly represented in the earnings calendar this week. The headline act is Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, with observers keen to hear more about how inflation is hitting household spending. However, just two months on from its full-year results, few expect the company to deviate from its cautious script that profits this year will be held back by the need to keep prices for shoppers in check.Among analysts’ comments, Barclays has forecast an overall decline of 1.8 per cent in the UK, with lower volumes partially offset by higher prices.","UK consumer spending is set to hit its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Bank of England's latest assessment of consumer spending in the wake of the Brexit vote.",positive

China's stock market,"New listings in China this year have raked in more than double the amount raised on Wall Street, after officials camped out at Shanghai’s stock exchange during the city’s strict lockdown to ensure a steady flow of deals.Total fundraising from initial public offerings in China has hit almost $35bn this year, compared with just $16bn on Wall Street, according to data from Dealogic.The strong showing for China’s IPO market came as authorities in Shanghai reacted swiftly after the city of 26mn entered a two-month lockdown, dispatching a squad of cadres to safeguard what is one of the most precious resources in China’s financial capital.As residents flooded social media with complaints about life under house arrest, China’s securities regulator sent officials to camp out at Shanghai’s stock exchange for the duration — by day, grilling listings applicants via videoconference before signing off on share sales, and by night sleeping on cots and inflatable mattresses, according to people familiar with the matter.The Shanghai Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China’s equity fundraising haul, up 7 per cent from a year ago, puts the country at the top of global rankings and stands in stark contrast to the rest of the world, where IPO proceeds have fallen 80 per cent as the war in Ukraine, surging inflation and central bank rate rises have rattled markets and delayed companies’ plans to go public.Bankers said the rush of Chinese listings was driven in part by Beijing’s desire to achieve “technological self-reliance”, with a special focus on sectors considered vital to economic growth and competition with the west including renewables, semiconductors and other high-end manufacturing."," China's stock market has overtaken the US for the first time in more than a decade, raising more than $10bn (Â£6bn) in initial public offerings (IPO) in the past year, according to industry figures.",positive

Revlon,"As Revlon prepares to negotiate its restructuring after filing for bankruptcy last week, the American cosmetics group still does not know the identity of all its key creditors, a consequence of a bizarre banking mistake.In August 2020, Citigroup mistakenly used its own money to repay a $900mn term loan it administered on behalf of Revlon that was held by multiple asset management groups. Holders of $400mn of the loan quickly returned the erroneous payment. However, funds that owned $500mn of the loan, many furious with Revlon over a previous debt restructuring, kept the cash.In 2021, a federal judge in New York said those who held on to the repayment were legally entitled to do so. Citi appealed against the decision. With the higher court yet to render a final ruling, Revlon faces the possibility that the repaid lenders will be forced to give back the proceeds and become Revlon creditors again.","Revlon may be one of the biggest names in the history of the cosmetics company, but it is not the only one in the world that has been caught up in a financial muddled up in the wake of its failure to repay its debts.",negative

Iron,"Iron ore prices — which fell 5 per cent on Monday — are following the same downward trajectory, as demand from Chinese steel producers stumbles. That is bad news for top producers such as Rio Tinto and BHP.A global economic slowdown approaches. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s attempts to slow US growth. Yet the other industrial Goliath, China, has shown only faltering signs of recovery from persistent Covid-19 shutdowns. Its voracious economy usually consumes about half of global industrial metal supply and more than 70 per cent of the world’s iron ore. A weak domestic steel market hints of what to expect for China’s economy.Property, a pillar of its economy, eats up about 40 per cent of Chinese steel suply, say analysts at Liberum. Floor space both sold and newly started is dropping at double-digit rates year on year, not seen since the global financial crisis.

The Bank of Japan,"The Bank of Japan has renewed its pledge to keep bond yields at zero, sending the yen lower and widening the policy gap with other central banks that have raised interest rates to tame inflation.The BoJ’s decision to stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy exacerbates a global divergence in yields after the US Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate by 0.75 percentage points this week, prompting Switzerland and the UK to also increase rates.The BoJ on Friday kept overnight interest rates at minus 0.1 per cent. It said it would conduct daily purchases of 10-year bonds at a yield of 0.25 per cent, showing no willingness to let bonds trade in a wider band.The decision triggered a sharp dip in the yen to ¥134.63 against the dollar, extending what has been a phase of exceptionally volatile trading.The yen’s recent plunge to historic lows against the dollar has placed the central bank in an awkward position ahead of elections for Japan’s upper house of parliament in July.The BoJ believes that underlying demand in the economy remains too weak to tighten monetary policy. But the soaring price of imported goods has upset the public and is likely to feature prominently during the campaign.Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food prices, have risen at their fastest pace in seven years, hitting the BoJ’s target with growth of 2.1 per cent in April.But there has almost been no follow-on from rising prices to higher wages. That has made the BoJ more confident than its counterparts in Europe and the US that the current bout of inflation will be transitory and that it needs to continue supporting the economy with monetary easing measures.", The yen has fallen to a fresh seven-year low against the dollar after the world's second-biggest central bank decided to keep interest rates on hold for a second time this year and raise rates for the first time in more than a decade.,positive
Ethiopia,"Ethiopia’s prime minister Abiy Ahmed said this month that his government would negotiate with fighters in the northern Tigray region to end a war that has not only unleashed human rights abuses and killed thousands of people but has also derailed one of Africa’s most promising economies.Until civil war broke out in November 2020, Ethiopia — Africa’s second-most populous country with 114mn people — had been regarded by development economists as a success story, albeit one engineered by an authoritarian government.In the 15 years to 2019, driven by investment in agriculture, industry and infrastructure, the economy grew on average 7 per cent annually per capita, according to World Bank data, one of the fastest rates in the world. Although it was still relatively poor, with a nominal per capita gross domestic product of roughly $950 in 2020, years of growth had put it on the cusp of lower middle-income status.“There’s no doubt that Ethiopia made tremendous gains through the development-state approach,” said Kingsley Amoako, former executive-secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, referring to the country’s Asian-inspired state-led model.","Ethiopia's long-running civil war has been blamed by the UN for the country's poor performance in the 15 years since it emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, according to a new report from the World Bank.",negative

BlackStone,"Shares of Blackstone Mortgage Trust, which yielded more than 2.48%, changed hands as low as $30.83 on the day. Dividends are especially important to investors because they have historically accounted for a sizable portion of the stock market's total return.

But consider now that you've collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, boosting your return to 13.15%. Even reinvesting the dividend would only amount to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; therefore, collecting a yield above 8% would appear quite attractive in comparison if that yield is sustainable.
